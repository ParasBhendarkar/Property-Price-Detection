Session 8- 
Encoding Techniques Performed
   1. Ordinal Encoding -> R2 score -> Mainly works with tree based model
   2. One Hot Encoding -> R2 score -> Mainly works with Linear Model
   3. Target Encoding  -> R2 score -> Works with tree based model
Compare all three and use one of them


Things I observed --
  1. The mean absolute error for Ordinal Enocoding is near to 0.94 which means it is doing mistakes nearly  to 94 lakhs
